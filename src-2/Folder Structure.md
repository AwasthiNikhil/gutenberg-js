blocks/: This folder contains all your custom blocks, each in its own file. For example, Paragraph.js defines the "Paragraph" block, Heading.js for the "Heading" block, etc. This makes each blockâ€™s logic isolated and easy to manage.

components/: This folder contains UI components that are shared across blocks or the editor. For example, a settings panel that can be reused across multiple blocks, or an inserter component for adding blocks.

styles/: A folder dedicated to your custom CSS for the block editor. You can import individual CSS files into each block, or use a global one to style the editor.

utils/: A folder for utility functions like block validation, block transformation, helper functions for dealing with block attributes, etc.
